# sheCompiles - Project I (Lexical Analyzer)
For this compiler project concerning a Toy programming language, our group used the software of Flex, as well as Unix systems (like Linux and Terminal for Mac) to test and compile our overall programs. The purpose of this part of the project is to implement a lexical analyzer for a simple object-oriented programming language called Toy. For this implementation, using our program, it should be able to translate any input Toy program into a sequence of tokens, and create a symbol table using the trie structure for all keywords and user-defined identifiers.

## Installation
Install the software of Flex in a Unix environment! <br/>
*Example for Terminal/Mac users (make sure brew is installed):* <br/>
brew install flex
